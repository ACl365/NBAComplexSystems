    "4. Classified players into versatility types based on stability and adaptability\n",
    "5. Created player style preference vectors\n",
    "6. Generated optimal lineups for each team style\n",
    "7. Created comprehensive player fit visualizations\n",
    "8. Simulated player performance in different systems\n",
