    "1. Classified players into stability categories and quadrants based on their performance dynamics\n",
    "2. Analyzed case studies of players with different stability profiles\n",
    "3. Translated mathematical findings into basketball insights and strategic applications\n",
    "4. Compared traditional and dynamics-based player evaluation to identify market inefficiencies\n",
    "5. Performed uncertainty analysis to assess the robustness of our stability metrics\n",
    "6. Decomposed player performance into intrinsic skill, momentum, and contextual factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis demonstrates the value of applying dynamical systems theory to basketball analytics, providing insights that go beyond traditional statistical approaches. These insights can inform player acquisition, lineup construction, game strategy, and player development decisions, potentially giving teams a competitive advantage.\n",
